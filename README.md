# Coding Interview Mini-Project: ToDo List Frontend with Vue + Tanstack

Hi! To test your skills and workflow, you'll build a todo list app in our tech stack.
You'll have to replicate the layout from [this figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/6AanWQBI0Xr50RorsHPHS3/Coding-Interview-Project-TODO-Design-file?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=hCEwrNy2O0Lavetc-1).

Requirements:
- [ ] As a user, I want to save my todos 
- [ ] As a user, I want my todos to be persisted, so that they will still be there after deleting my browser cache 
- [ ] As a user, I want to be able to delete a single todo or all of them at once 
- [ ] As a user, I want to mark todos as finished/unfinished

This test project is not about getting it done as quick as possible or flexing on us with sophisticated algorithms. We want to see, how you work, what your code looks like and how you tackle problems. Feel free to ask questions! You will have to be able to communicate with us, so we can effectively work together. 
You're allowed to use any resource, as if you were actually coding- chatgpt, youtube, stackoverflow, whatever floats your boat. The result is the only thing that matters to us!
